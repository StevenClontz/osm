# OSM's Mission

We generate a lot of scholarly activity in academia. Many
campuses hold regular seminars and colloquia which showcase cutting-edge
research in various areas of mathematics. However, researchers at smaller
institutions often find
themselves isolated from their colleagues elsewhere and
cannot take advantage of these events.

Our mission is to provide software
and support for mathematicians to stream talks from existing seminars
to the internet, without adding extra overhead to the involved researchers.
In doing so, the reach these seminars have can extend
beyond the physical borders of a university campus, and researchers at
other institutions can take part in these events.

## Start streaming your seminar

Instructions on how to set up your own seminar stream can be found on our
[Github page](https://github.com/StevenClontz/osm).

#### Get involved

Are you interested in open research and helping broadcast academic
activity at your institution to a larger audience? Email Steven at
[steven.clontz+osm@gmail.com](mailto:steven.clontz+osm@gmail.com)
and get in touch.

## Pilot episode

Steven Clontz presented joint work with Scott Varagona on generalized
inverse limits with ordinal-valued index sets at Auburn University's
[Continuum Theory seminar](http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/math/research/seminars/topology-continuum-theory.htm).
