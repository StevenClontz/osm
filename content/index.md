# OSM's Mission

We generate a lot of scholarly activity in academia. Many
campuses hold regular seminars and colloquia which showcase cutting-edge
research in various areas of mathematics. However, researchers at smaller
institutions often find
themselves isolated from their colleagues elsewhere and
cannot take advantage of these events.

Our mission is to provide software
and support for mathematicians to stream talks from existing seminars
to the internet, without adding extra overhead to the involved researchers.
In doing so, the reach these seminars have can extend
beyond the physical borders of a university campus, and researchers at
other institutions can take part in these events.
