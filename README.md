# Online Seminars in Mathematics

The OSM project serves to allow mathematical seminars to easily stream their content online to be shared with the larger mathematical community.

This README outlines the personnel, hardware, and software required to produce a stream, as well as the logistics of running the stream.

## Joining OSM

Right now, OSM is an invite-only series of mathematical seminars. However, you may still use the below instructions to run your own stream, and you may contact the OSM organizer Steven Clontz at steven.clontz@gmail.com for your seminar to be considered for inclusion in the future.

## Required Personnel

An OSM stream requires only two people:

* A moderator to set up the equipment and software, to monitor the stream for errors, and to moderate questions submitted by the seminar's live and online audiences
* A speaker to present a topic relevant to the seminar

OSM streams are designed to support both live and online audiences (so as to extend the audience of a traditional seminar, not replace it with an online format).

## Required Hardware/Services

* A relatively recent MacBook (this guide was created using a 2009 MacBook Pro) for use by the speaker. In particular, it should have a built-in camera and microphone.
* A second device (tablet/laptop) for the moderator.
* A stable Wi-Fi or wired internet connection for both devices
* A writing tablet (this guide was using a Wacom Bamboo tablet which is no longer in production - any suggestions on an economical tablet?).
* A projector (and any adapters required to connect MacBook to it)

That's it. We aimed for the MacBook platform simply because it has less variance between models compared to Windows PCs and usually available to borrow at various campuses. However, it's reasonable to expect that a newer Windows 8 PC with built-in pen-based touch support may also work for running a stream (with different software than outlined here).
